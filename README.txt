This Movie Trailer Website Project#1 consists of 3 Python version 2.7.9 files that store a list of movies titles, along with its 

respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. 

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or 

poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and groups all the 

instances together in a list.

The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies 

and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
